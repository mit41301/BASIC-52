The first printing is Copyright 1994.
The second printing is Copyright 1994, 1997.

The following errors are in both printings:

Page 18.
In Table 2-2:
pin 18 is XTAL2 output
pin 19 is XTAL1 Input

Page 50.
Due to many reported problems in using various EEPROMs with the 8052-Basic circuit, I recommend using NVRAM or EPROM. 

Page 56.
Under "Adding More NVRAM or EEPROM":
Change:
pin 10 of U4
to
pin 10 of U6

Page 84.
Change:
STRING  expressions,expression2
to
STRING  expression1, expression2-1

Page 121. Figure 7-9. On the 74HCT32, the -READ input should be pin 4, and 
the output should be pin 6.

Page 122.
Under "Testing the Keypad":
Change
Listing 7-3 tests Figure 4's circuit.
to
Listing 7-3 tests Figure 7-9's circuit.

Page 122
Under "Testing the Keypad", fifth paragraph:
Change
In line 110, 8+1FF0h=1FF8h, and the value stored at 1FF8h in
to
In line 110, 8+1F00h=1F08h, and the value stored at 1F08h in

Page 142.
In Table 8-2, under Function set:
Change
N: dual (1), single (1) line display
to
N: dual (1), single (0) line display

Page 147.
In Listing 8-4, you may need a delay loop between lines 830 and 840
and between lines 920 and 930 (to wait until the LCD isn't busy).

On page 244 (Listing 14-2), change line 9130 from:
9130 IF (G<>49.OR.G<>54) THEN END
to:
9130 IF (G<49.OR.G>54) THEN END

The following errors are in the first printing only:

Page 39. Change:
20 END
to:
40 END

Page 59. In Figure 4-5, change the output pin of U10B from pin 8 to pin 5.

Page 79 (from Seymour M Foos). Change:
ON X GOT0 100,200,300
to:
ON X GOSUB 100, 200, 300 

Page 141 (from Ton Grift). In Table 8-1, pin 1 is Signal ground and 
pin 2 is Supply voltage (+5V).

Page 265. In Listing B-1, change line 175 from:
CHECK=CHECK+CH1
to:
CHECK=CHECK+CH
