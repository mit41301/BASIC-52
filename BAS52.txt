BAS52.TXT   
Document file for the BASIC-52 software.
This file was last revised 5/7/2003


The original BASIC-52 was placed into the public domain by Intel.
Gary Muhonen of Iota Systems, Inc. (gary@dcity.org) modified BASIC-52 by adding extensions called
BASIC-52 PLUS. 

These software is now in the public domain. 

Gary Muhonen does not support this software in any way.


There are four main vesions of basic supplied on this disk. 

1. BAS52.ASM and BAS52FP.ASM
       BASIC-52 upgraded by Iota Systems (but without the PLUS extensions)
       Use BAS52.MAK to 'make' this version.
       BAS52.HEX is a hex file of this version.

2. BAS52.ASM, BAS52FP.ASM, and BASPLUS.ASM
       BASIC-52 PLUS, which includes the Iota extensions
       Use BASPLUS.MAK to 'make' this version.
       BASPLUS.HEX is a hex file of this version.

3. BAS52_B3.ASM, BAS52FP.ASM, and BASPLUS.ASM
       BASIC-52 PLUS, but modified for a FIXED baud rate of
       9600 baud, assuming a 11.0592MHz crystal. The
       baud rate can be changed by changing timer2 setup
       registers. This version is useful for use of
       Basic-52 with the Dallas 80C320 processor.
       Use BAS52_B3.MAK to 'make' this version.
       BAS52_B3.HEX is a hex file of this version.

4. INTEL.SRC and INTELFP.SRC  -- this is the original source code 
       from Intel for BASIC-52.



Here is a list of all the files.


BAS52.DOC   is this file

BAS52.ASM   the main BASIC-52 assembly source file for basic. This is the
            version that is modified by Iota Systems and is Version 1.1b.
            It is written for the Franklin assembler but can be modified
            for other assemblers. Iota made several changes to the basic
            from the original, and these changes are outlined at the
            beginning of this file. BAS52.MAK can be used to 'make' 
            this version of BASIC-52 (without the PLUS extensions)

BAS52_B3.ASM  same as above, except modified for fixed baud rate of 9600
            baud (assuming a crystal of 11.0592 MHz). This version is
            useful for the Dallas 80C320 processor.

BAS52FP.ASM this is the second file that makes up BASIC-52. It contains
            the floating point math routines. It is also written for the
            Franklin assembler.

BASPLUS.ASM is the assembly source file for the extensions to BASIC-52
            that are part of BASIC-52 PLUS. This file when assembled and
            linked with the BAS52.ASM and BAS52FP.ASM above form the
            product called BASIC-52 PLUS. The extensions to basic include
            monitor commands for displaying and changing memory. Also
            added are commands for uploading and downloading INTEL HEX
            files.

BAS52.HEX   this is an INTEL hex file for BASIC-52 Version 1.1b without
            the PLUS. It is the result of assembling BAS52.ASM and
            BAS52FP.ASM above, and linking the files together into one hex
            file.

BASPLUS.HEX is an INTEL hex file for BASIC-52 PLUS. It includes both BASIC-52
            and the extensions.

BAS52_B3.HEX is an INTEL hex file for BASIC-52 PLUS modified for 9600 baud.


BAS52.MAK   is a 'make' file for assembling and linking the above files. It
            is written for Microsoft's MAKE utility program, but easily
            converted to other brands of MAKE. (Of course you will need
            the Franklin assembler and linker too. Or you can change the
            command lines to work with your assembler and linker).


BASPLUS.MAK is a 'make file for assembling and linking all the files needed
            to make up BASIC-52 PLUS.
            It is written for Microsoft's MAKE utility program, but easily
            converted to other brands of MAKE. (Of course you will need
            the Franklin assembler and linker too. Or you can change the
            command lines to work with your assembler and linker).

BAS52_B3.MAK is a 'make file for assembling and linking all the files needed
            to make up BASIC-52 PLUS with the fixed 9600 baud rate.
            It is written for Microsoft's MAKE utility program, but easily
            converted to other brands of MAKE. (Of course you will need
            the Franklin assembler and linker too. Or you can change the
            command lines to work with your assembler and linker).


INTEL.SRC   this is the original source for BASIC-52 as supplied by INTEL.
            It is for version 1.1.

INTELFP.SRC this is the original source for the floating point routines in
            BASIC-52.

BASOP.INC   An include file (included in BASPLUS.ASM) that contains op-
            codes for functions in BASIC-52. This file is also useful if
            you are writing your own assembly language code that uses
            functions built into BASIC-52.
